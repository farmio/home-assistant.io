## Code Editor bug & Safari

We are aware of bug with CodeMirror, the code editor in Home Assistant that
used for things like YAML, when using the Safari browser.

We currently advise not to use Safari when using the code editor in
Home Assistant.

We are working with the upstream project to have this fixed during the beta.

## Database upgrades & performance

There is a database upgrade this release, but worry not as database upgrades
now happen in the background and no longer prevent Home Assistant from starting.

Thanks to [@lmagyar] and [@raman325] we now can store events up to
64 characters and the recorder won’t get stuck if there is one exceeding that
length.

And if you have ever had to wait for the recorder to shutdown, worry no more
as Home Assistant can now shut down successfully, even when the database is
broken.

Talking about broken databases: If you have ever had database corruption of
your sqlite database, you probably know how much of a pain it is to get things
back up and running again. We recently added live recovery to allow
Home Assistant to recover and start a new database when the recorder encountered
corruption when saving events or states to the database. This release extends
this live recovery to work during migration and purge.This also means no more
waiting for a database check on unclean shutdown!

Finally, the recorder performance has been improved and SD Cards should last
a bit longer now, as we reduced how frequently we write to the database.

## Startup visibility - What is taking so long?

TODO:
- Some rewording / flow fixes
- Screenshot

Ever wondered why starting up Home Assistant took so long?

Stop wondering, as you can now see which integration is delaying startup as
the integration taking the longest time to setup is now displayed when
Home Assistant is starting.

## Ever wonder why Home Assistant didn’t restart when you pressed the restart button?

TODO:
- Title...
- Wording/flow adjustments

The restart button now provides feedback so you know right away if a restart
can’t happen because of invalid config, broken integration, or database upgrade
in progress.

We adjusted timeouts and fixed a few places were shutdown would block
forever, for example, when restarting Home Assistant the configuration gets
checked and there was a case that could hang in this check forever.

Restarts are faster now... (WTH https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-stopping-service-is-too-slow/220507),
as more parts of Home Assistant now cancel/react to the shutdown procedure
better.

We also audited the top 35 integrations to make sure they stop polling on stop.
Thanks for {% my general title="turning on analytics" %}!

## Memory Leaks

TODO:
- Extend or move to other noteworthy changes

We did an audit of memory leaks and fixed a couple of generic cases in our core
codebase. But also fixed over 15 cases during unload/reload in popular
integrations.

## Updated look and feel for the integration dashboard

TODO:

- Screenshot
- Improve flow/writing

The {% my integrations title="Integrations dashboard" %} has been updated to
have a more compacted look and provide more useful information.

For example, it now shows the state of the integration and in case of a
failure, it will now tell you why that is.

Additionally, you can now recognize integrations that rely on the cloud
(they show a little cloud label) and integration that are installed as
custom integration (they show a little package label).

## Color modes!

TODO:
- Make story out of it
- Add screenshot

We now have support RGBWW, RGBW and many more color modes! Previously, we
relied mainly on HS & Brightness (HSB/HSV) and colors in Home Assistant was
based on that. But now, an integration can provide the actual color mode an
light supports. This allow Home Assistant (and integration to adjust the
behavior for the light better.

For example, the frontend will adjust the color picker based on the color mode
of the light.

<insert screenshot>

At this moment not all integrations are able to support color modes yet.

## Enter and exit criteria improvements for zones

TODO:

- Improve wording/flow a little
- Pull down image locally, use standard image block
- link justus502
- Maybe move up a little?

The enter and exit criteria for zones have been improved this release.

So, location updates from device trackers have a center location and an accuracy.
The true location of the device can be anywhere within the circle centered at
location, with radius accuracy. Likewise, zones are circular defined by a center
location and a radius.

The previous criteria for zones would at every location update find the zone
nearest to the center of the location update where the circles defined by the
location update and the zone were overlapping, no matter how big the circle
defined by the location update was.

This meant it was possible to jump in to a very small zone based on a highly
inaccurate location update.

To illustrate further, @justus502 made an illustration:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14281572/115867224-165ab080-a43b-11eb-9deb-68d0763e321e.png" width="500" height="500">

The brown circles are the GPS-coordinates in the center and the (in)accuracy
sent by the device. The green circles are zones and their center in the middle.
The red circle is the actual location of the device.

The old logic would consider the device to be within all three zones
(the green circles), and would pick the one to the upper left.

As of this release it no longer enter a zone unless the location
(the brown circle) is entirely within the green circle, this means none of the
three zones in the illustration would be entered.

Once a zone has been entered however, less accurate location updates
(a larger brown circle) are allowed, and the zone won't be exited unless the
location (brown circle) is no longer overlapping the zone (the green circle).

TL;DR: This change will improve the zone a tracked device is in, is
be less "jumpy" and will reduce false positives.

## Breaking Changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Custom integration" %}

Custom integrations now require a version key in their manifest file, this also
means that all custom integrations now require a manifest file.

If you are using a legacy custom integration like `custom_components/awesome.py`
this now needs to move to `custom_components/awesome/__init__.py` so you can
add `custom_components/awesome/manifest.json` to it.

For more information about integration, manifests have a look here:
<https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/creating_integration_manifest>

Custom integrations that do not have this will be blocked from loading if
it’s missing a version in the manifest starting with Home Assistant 2021.6.

If you see these errors, please report the issue with the author of that
custom integration.

([@ludeeus] - [#49726])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Travel Time" %}

The Google Travel Time integration is now configured via the UI. Configuring
the integration via YAML is now deprecated. Existing YAML configuration is
automatically imported on upgrade and can be safely removed after upgrade.

([@raman325] - [#43509])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Garmin Connect" %}

The unit of measurement from Garmin Connect timestamp sensors has been removed.
It used to be set to empty string. If you have automations, scripts or external
data recvorder that rely on unit of measurement for these sensors, you might
need to adjust to this change.

([@MartinHjelmare] - [#48431])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "System Monitor" %}

The unit of measurement from System Monitor timestamp sensors has been removed.
It used to be set to empty string. If you have automations, scripts or external
data recvorder that rely on unit of measurement for these sensors, you might
need to adjust to this change.

([@MartinHjelmare] - [#48431])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Enphase Envoy" %}

Enphase Envoy has fully transitioned to configuration via UI. YAML configuration
will be removed in an upcoming version. Existing YAML configuration will be
imported automatically, and can now safely be removed from your configuration
files.

All sensors are now configured by default. Each inverter has a unique ID and
can now be disabled in the UI.

([@bdraco] - [#48517])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Waze Travel Time" %}

The Waze Travel Time integration is now configured via the UI. Configuring
the integration via YAML is now deprecated. Existing YAML configuration is
automatically imported on upgrade and can be safely removed after upgrade.

([@raman325] - [#43419])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ASUSWRT" %}

The `device_tracker` entity state attribute `ip_address` has been changed and is
now be named `ip`. You need to update automations and scripts that use this
attribute.

([@bieniu] - [#48764])

{% enddetails %}

{% details " Recollect Waste" %}

Recollect Waste pickup dates are now stored as UTC timestamps.

([@bachya] - [#48690])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "KNX" %}

The `config_file` YAML option for KNX was deprecated before and has now been
removed.

([@marvin-w] - [#48799])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Events" %}

An event fired with an `event_type` of more than 64 characters would previously
result in recorder errors but the event would otherwise work. Now, firing an
event with more than 64 characters in the event type will raise immediately.

If you are using long events in your automations or scripts, you should adjust
to this change. Custom integration authors should review their event types.

([@raman325] - [#48115])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Hive" %}

The existing Hive service `heating_boost` will be deprecated in Home Assistant
release 2021.0.6 and a new service to replace it has been created called
`heating_boost_on`.

If you use the `heating_boost` Hive service please update your configuration
to the new service. A deprecation warning will be printed to the logs when the
deprecated service is used.

([@KJonline] - [#48701])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Ezviz" %}

The Ezviz integration is now configured via the UI. Configuring
the integration via YAML is now deprecated. Existing YAML configuration is
automatically imported on upgrade and can be safely removed after upgrade.

All camera state attributes were removed and replaced by binary_sensors,
sensors or switches.

List of old camera state attributes with their new replacements:

- "privacy": switch entity, camera_name.privacy
- "audio": switch entity, camera_name.sound
- "ir_led": switch entity, camera_name.infrared
- "state_led": switch entity, camera_name.light
- "follow_move": switch entity, camera_name.tracking
- "alarm_notify": camara status, "Recording"
- "alarm_sound_mod": sensor, camera_name.alarm_sound_mod
- "encrypted": binary_sensor, camera_name.encrypted
- "local_ip": sensor, camera_name.local_ip
- "detection_sensibility": sensor, camera_name.detection_sensibility

If you are using one of these attributes in your automations or scripts, you
will need to adjust to this change.

([@RenierM26] - [#45722])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Litter-Robot" %}

`reset_waste_drawer`, `set_sleep_mode`, and `set_wait_time` now have their own
services. Previously, they were triggered by using `send_command`.
If you used any of those commands in your automations or scripts, you'll need
to replace them with their service counter-part.

([@natekspencer] - [#48300])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Recorder" %}

Database migrations are now done in the background and no longer prevent
Home Assistant from starting.

The migration is started shortly after the started event since they are CPU
intensive (mostly just sqlite since its in the same process) and we do not want
to compete with startup.

Events created by your system are queued and processed when the migration is
completed. There is a safety to start discarding events if more than ~30000
events happen before migration is completed to avoid memory exhaustion.

During migration, Home Assistant will prevent being start or stopped and
this will also disable the `homeassistant.stop` and `homeassistant.start`
services until the migration has been completed.

The sqlite database recovery logic can now recover at point after setup
including purge, migration, and event insert. In short we can _always_
(hopefully) recover and start a new db without a restart.

The quick check is no longer performed on unclean shutdown since we can always
recover live. The `db_integrity_check` option has been deprecated.

([@bdraco] - [#49036] [#49098])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "SMA Solar" %}

The SMA integration is now configured via the UI. Configuring the integration
via YAML is now deprecated. Existing YAML configuration is automatically
imported on upgrade and can be safely removed after upgrade.

Using custom sensors is deprecated and not possible using the UI. Feel free to
submit additional sensors to be added as standard sensors to the
[pysma library](https://github.com/kellerza/pysma/blob/master/pysma/__init__.py#L100).

([@rklomp] - [#48003])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Swiss Hydrological Data" %}

FEON/BAFU changed their data which required removing some of the attributes.

The following attributes are no longer available:

- delta-24h
- max-1h
- min-1h
- mean-1h
- previous-24h

([@Bouni] - [#49119])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Shelly" %}

The Shelly Wi-fi RSSI sensor unit was wrong, it is **dBm** and not **dB**.
If you rely on the unit of measurement from this sensor, you might need to
adjust to this change.

([@thecode] - [#49265])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "GNTP (Growl)" %}

The GNTP (Growl) integration has been deprecated and is going to be removed in
Home Assistant Core 2021.6.

The Growl project has now fully retired, see: <https://growl.github.io/growl/>

([@frenck] - [#49273])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ecobee" %}

ecobee climate devices will change the reported temperature precision for their
`current_temperature` attribute from whole degrees to 0.1 degree increments.
Automations which rely on whole-number precision may need adjustments.

([@bjpetit] - [#48086])

Setting a fan hold in the ecobee integration will no longer also set a
temperature hold. If any automations assumed that the temperature would be set
when calling the set_fan_mode service on an ecobee device, those automations
will need to add the appropriate `set_temperature` service call.

([@jjlawren] - [#48697])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ZeroConf" %}

If the `default_interface` is not set, the value is auto-detected based on the
system routing next hop for the mDNS broadcast address (`224.0.0.251`).

If the next-hop cannot be detected or is a loopback address, `zeroconf` will
broadcast on all interfaces. If the next hop is a non-loopback address,
`zeroconf` will only broadcast on the default interface.

Setting the `default_interface` to `true` or `false` will override the auto
detection.

([@bdraco] - [#49529])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AVM FRITZ!Box Tools" %}

The AVM FRITZ!Box Tools integration is now configured via the UI. Configuring
the integration via YAML is now deprecated. Existing YAML configuration is
automatically imported on upgrade and can be safely removed after upgrade.

([@chemelli74] - [#48287])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "AVM FRITZ!SmartHome" %}

YAML configuration for AVM FRITZ!SmartHome has been removed, after it has been
deprecated for 12 months. Configuration via UI is fully integrated. Existing
YAML configuration has already been imported automatically in the previous
releases and can now safely be removed from your configuration files.

([@mib1185] - [#49663])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Modbus" %}

A new option `SWAP` replaces `REVERSE_ORDER`, however `REVERSE_ORDER` is
still accepted and silently converted to `SWAP=WORD`.

Note: `REVERSE_ORDER` will be removed in a future release.

Old configuration example:

```yaml
modbus:
  sensors:
    - name: "sensor1"
      address: 17
      reverse_order: true
      ...
   - name: "sensor2"
      address: 17
      reverse_order: false
      ...
```

New configuration example:

```yaml
modbus:
  sensors:
    - name: "sensor1"
      address: 17
      swap: word
      ...
   - name: "sensor2"
      address: 17
      swap: none
      ...
```

Swap allows `none`/`byte`/`word`/`word_byte` options.

([@janiversen] - [#49719])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Sure Petcare" %}

The following YAML configuration options have been deprecated:

- `feeders`
- `flaps`
- `pets`
- `scan_interval`

If you have one of these options in your YAML cnfiguration, you can safely
remove those.

([@benleb] - [#49223])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "RoonLabs music player" %}

The RoonLabs music player `media_player` previous had integration specific
services for `roon.join` and `roon.un_join`. These have been removed removes
and replaced with the `media_player.join` and `media_player.unjoin` services.

If you use these services in your automations or script, you need to adjust those.

([@pavoni] - [#49667])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "DHT Sensor" %}

The `pin` configuration option is currently is an integer but will need to be
prefixed with D for Raspberry Pi platforms.

Please adjust your YAML configuration for this change.

([@TheGardenMonkey] - [#41525])

{% enddetails %}

## Farewell to the following

The following integrations are no longer available as of this release:

- **Geizhals** has been removed. ([@frenck] - [#48594])
- **Social Blade** has been removed. ([@frenck] - [#48677])

Both integrations were in a broken state and using webscaping methods to gather
their data, which is not allowed for core integrations.
